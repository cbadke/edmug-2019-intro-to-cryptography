# Intro to Cryptography

This is a presentation I gave to the Edmonton .NET User Group on 2019-02-26. The slides were presented using [mdp](https://github.com/visit1985/mdp).

I am not a cryptography expert, this presentation is meant to share things I've been learning about with my community. As such, I welcome feedback and corrections.
